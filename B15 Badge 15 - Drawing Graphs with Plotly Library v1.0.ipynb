    "# Plotly - interactive graphs library\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a simplified version of and introduction to  plot.ly/python/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will cover:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating graphs and combining them into more complex inphographics\n",
    "- Editing/Updating Graphs\n",
    "- Types of Graphs (just briefly, you'll go to documentation by yourself to find out more)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap: Important core concepts \n",
    "\n",
    "**DICTIONARIES** hold key-value pairs. I plotly we will use dictionaries interchangably with objects to modify graphs. Often you will assign dictionaries as values in other dictionaries, like in\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "graph_info = {\n",
    "   \"data\": [{ \"type\": \"bar\",\n",
    "              \"x\": [\"banana\", \"kiwi\", \"plum\"],\n",
    "              \"y\": [2, 5, 4]}],\n",
    "    \"layout\": {\"title\": {\"text\": \"A Bar Chart\"}}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**CLASSES** are complicated data types (like List, Dict, etc) that you create yourimport from a library. You uually use a class to ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**CREATE AN OBJECT OF A CLASS** by which you create a new item/instance of this class (like you created a new List or Dict with [ ] or { } ). When you have an object you can interacti with it - just like you can change a List object with .pop() or .sort(). You create graph objects by using constructor, like ```fig = Figure( some_ttributes )``` or you can use a factpry method that will create an object and return it to you ```fig = px.scatter( ... )```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBJECT** is yoru primary item you will work with when creating graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have create an object you can change perform methods on it like \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fig.show()   \n",
    "fig.add_bar( ... )   \n",
    "fig.update_yaxes( ... )\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also change its attributes like \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fig.data[1].marker.line.color = \"yellow\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTING LIBRARIES** is a process via which we give our notebook ability to use classes and code written by someone else. We specify library we want and its short name  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import library_you_want as short_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and the ones we will use the most are \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objects as go        \n",
    "import plotly.express as px      \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTING INDIVIDUAL METHODS/CLASSES FROM A LIBRARY** when we want just a small part of a library (optionally we can specify it ad give it a short handy name) \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from library_you_want import function_or_class_you_want\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which will look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing plotly on your notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's import plotly from Python Index of Packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: ```pip install some_library``` is a command that will install any pip library you request from the Python Package Index. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python Package Index is like a phone book of all available Python libraries, it contains hundreds of thousands of libraries for anything you can imagine: Data, Graphs, Maps, AI, Internet... You can go and browse them yourself at https://pypi.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we will only grab the Plotly from there with the below line of code. Because every time you start a Noteable notebook/session you are effectively startig a new instance of a server, you will need to run this code every time you ope a new session. "

    "\n",
    "```{ 'name': 'Scotland', 'population': 5438000 }```\n",
    "\n",
    "but you can also create a dict object, and specify it's attributes, with a **dict()** constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "```dict(name='Scotland', population = 5438000)```\n",
    "\n",
    "notice differences in brackets around keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "- {} syntax uses : to separete keys and values. Keys are in ''\n",
    "- dict() sytax uses = to separete keys and values\n",

    "You will see both syntaxes in this notebook, often without particular reason. They both work interchangably. Try to be cinsistent, but use one which is most conveninent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using learning datasets provided by plotly (we'll use Iris flower data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly has included some datasets for you to play with. We will use dataset about flowers called Iris. Here you can find its descrition:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What's important for us in Iris dataset is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- species holds a umber one of three values which we will use to split data into 3 groups\n",
    "- sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width hold numbers, which we will use to drag diagrams"
