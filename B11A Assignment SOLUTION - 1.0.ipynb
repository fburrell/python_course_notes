We'd also like to show the average lengths of movies in these groups, and state if longer movies have better ratings.\n",

We also attempted to write tests that did not depend on API results, but rather mock data\n",

    "- Problem 1: A convention of Scottish Star Wars movie fans is preparing for a bit outdoors cosplay meeting and are considering three locations: Glasgow, Edinburgh and Falkirk. They would like to know what is the weather like right now in these locations. Print on the screen the weather information about these locations right now in a way that makes it easy to compare and make a decision where the costume party should happen. Can your code suggest the location (eg. one which is warmest). Extra: If the event cannot happen now, which location has the best weather tomorrow or on another day?\n",

    "- Problem 2: Actors' associations is preparing for their annual haloween photo shoot in Edinburgh Castle, and it has to happen within next 10 days. It will have to happen at night and outside, so they need you to identify the day when it's least likely to rain in Edinburgh and the moon is brightest. Look at the forecast data and extract 'daily_chance_of_rain' and 'moon_illumination' values. Then present the information about next 10 days. Suggest the day when it's least likely to rain and one when the moon is brightest. Extra: Because of security reasons the castle needs to close at midnight - assuming the photoshoot needs to happen at least an hour after sunset, and once the moon has risen, how much time would they have each night to perform the photoshoot? (you can look at 'moonrise' and 'sunset' values).\n"

    "\n",
    "We have access to the api with weather information for cities which produces forecast for next 3 days. We will print information for 3 Scottish cities. Such report will be created for each of the next 3 days. Report will indicate which city is warmest and which least rainy, for each of days. We will indicate preferences with emoji symbols to enable user to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Analysis & Results: What analysis you prefromed in your python code and what were the results\n",
    "\n",
    "We wrote a number of functions and their tests that aquire, and prepare the data. We also wrote functions that prepare the report and present it. We used a separate function to aquire API data and to filter it to a particular day, which enabled us to just ask API a small number of times at the beginning, and then just use data. Additionally, only once all data is aquired we can find out which city is warmest, that's why separating getting data and reporting on them was a good call.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: \n",
    "On the day of writing Edinburgh was the warmest and least rainy city of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Falkirk. Emojis make it easier to see which city is most suitable, and additionally, if one city is both warmest and most dry, it is indicated with a heart. The code can handle a situation where two cities are equally warm (both will get an icon)."
